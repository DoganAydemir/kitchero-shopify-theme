## Overview

Kitchero is a premium Shopify theme built for merchants selling high-end kitchen cabinets, countertops, and home-design products. It offers a showroom-grade visual experience with cinematic animations, while remaining fully editable through the Shopify theme editor.

**Key features:**

- **Two product page layouts** — E-commerce style (gallery + sticky info) and Showroom style (alternating full-width / paired gallery)
- **Three collection layouts** — horizontal filter bar, right-side filter drawer, left sticky sidebar
- **Mega menu navigation** — 3-level menus render as grid-style mega menus, 2-level menus as flyout dropdowns
- **GSAP + ScrollTrigger + Lenis** — self-hosted vendor libraries for buttery-smooth scroll animations and parallax effects
- **Product countdown timer** — backed by `custom.deal_ends_at` metafield (real offer end date, not fake urgency)
- **Star ratings + color swatches** — reads Shopify's native `reviews.rating` metafield or custom fallback
- **AJAX collection filtering** — Shopify Section Rendering API, no full-page reload
- **AJAX cart drawer** — variant switching, quantity updates, and add-to-cart without page reload
- **6 languages out of the box** — English, Turkish, German, French, Spanish, Arabic (RTL)
- **4 color schemes** — Light Stone, Dark, Emerald, Midnight
- **3-font system** — Inter (headings + body) + Playfair Display (serif accent)
- **WCAG AA accessible** — keyboard-navigable, screen-reader-friendly, visible focus rings, 4.5:1 color contrast
- **Full @app block support** — product, cart, header, footer sections accept app blocks
- **Progressive enhancement** — every form and interaction works without JavaScript

---

## Requirements

- **Shopify plan:** Any paid plan (Basic and up)
- **Theme Store compatibility:** Shopify OS 2.0
- **Optional review app:** Any app that populates the `reviews.rating` metafield (Shopify Product Reviews, Judge.me, Loox, Stamped, etc.) — the theme also supports a manual `custom.rating` fallback

---

## Initial setup

After installing the theme, complete these steps to get it fully operational. Detailed instructions are in [`SETUP.md`](./SETUP.md).

### 1. Create required metafields

The theme reads two optional product metafields. Create them in **Settings > Custom data > Products**:

| Namespace & key | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `custom.deal_ends_at` | Date and time | Powers the countdown timer on deal products |
| `custom.rating` | Decimal (0–5) | Manual fallback star rating if you don't use a review app |

### 2. Set up navigation menus

- **Main menu:** 2 levels = flyout dropdown, 3 levels = full mega menu. Assign to Header section.
- **Footer menus:** Multiple menu blocks in the Footer section, each can reference a different menu.

### 3. Configure theme settings

Open **Theme editor > Theme settings** (gear icon) and configure:

- **Logo** — upload your brand logo
- **Colors** — pick one of 4 built-in schemes or customize
- **Typography** — Inter + Playfair Display defaults, or swap via font picker
- **Social media** — Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, X, Pinterest links
- **Cart** — drawer (default) or full-page cart

### 4. Assign alternate templates

For collections and products, you can assign alternate templates in the admin:

- `collection.drawer` — right-side filter drawer
- `collection.vertical` — left sticky sidebar filters
- `product.showroom` — showroom-style product page with alternating gallery

## Architecture notes

- **CSS:** Plain vanilla CSS with BEM naming (`.kt-*` prefix). No Sass, no Tailwind in output, no build step. Each section loads its own CSS file via `{{ 'section-*.css' | asset_url | stylesheet_tag }}`.
- **JavaScript:** Vanilla JS with IIFE scoping. No frameworks, no build step. One file per interactive section. GSAP, ScrollTrigger, and Lenis are self-hosted in `assets/vendor-*.js` (unminified, per Theme Store rules).
- **Liquid:** Uses `{% render %}` (never `{% include %}`). All schemas use `t:` translation keys. All strings are localized via `{{ 'key' | t }}`.
- **Progressive enhancement:** All forms use Shopify `{% form %}` tags (auto action/method). Navigation uses real `<a href>` links. The cart drawer falls back to `/cart` when JS is off. CSS-only dropdowns via `:hover` and `:focus-within`.
- **Performance:** All `<img>` use `image_tag` with explicit `width`/`height` and `loading="lazy"`. All scripts use `defer`. Fonts loaded via `font_face` with `font_display: swap`.
- **Accessibility:** WCAG AA compliant. Skip-to-content link, `role="main"` landmark, `<nav aria-label>`, visible focus rings (`:focus-visible`), `aria-label` on icon-only buttons, `aria-expanded` on toggles.

## Internationalization

The theme ships with 6 locales:

| Code | Language | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `en` | English | Default |
| `tr` | Turkish | — |
| `de` | German | — |
| `fr` | French | — |
| `es` | Spanish | — |
| `ar` | Arabic | RTL (right-to-left) |

Enable additional languages in **Settings > Languages**. Storefront strings live in `locales/*.json`; theme editor labels live in `locales/*.schema.json`.

## Browser support

merchant-droppable sections grouped into 9 categories (heroes, sliders, video,
galleries, testimonials, image+text, collapsibles, commerce, newsletter).

See [`docs/SECTIONS.md`](./docs/SECTIONS.md) for the full catalogue, organized
